# listed-client

## Description

This repository contains the source code for the Listed Inventory Management System client application.

## Frameworks and Tools

- Node.js - v18.16.0
- React Native v0.72 with Expo v49
- Native Base - component library

## Folder Structure

- everything is inside the src directory
- since we are using expo router for our navigation, we will be putting our screens inside the app directory following a file-based routing structure
- we will be using the following folder structure for our components
- components are divided into 3 categories: atoms, molecules, and organisms

## Conventions

### File Naming

- folders/directories - kebab-case
- screens/layouts (`index.tsx`, `login.tsx`, `_layout.tsx`) - kebab-case
- ComponentFiles (.tsx) - PascalCase
- otherFiles (utils.ts) - camelCase

### Inside Files

- variables and objectInstances - camelCase
- ComponentNames - PascalCase
- functionNames - camelCase
- Use react arrow function components (`rnfe` snippet if you have ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native/JS snippets extension installed)
- _use double quotes for JSX/TSX attributes and do not enclose string literals in curly braces_
